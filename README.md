# Har Viewer

---

This project allows to you to submit a .har file and filter it's view, generating a JSON representation of the main info and also generate a PHP/Guzzle chain of requests that mimic what the .har did.

The processing of the .har file is done in the browser, no need for a backend of any sort.

This project was most entirely made by AI.
